# Evaluating Named Entity Recognition: A Comparative Analysis of Mono- and Multilingual Transformer Models on a Novel Brazilian Corporate Earnings Call Transcripts Dataset

This repository includes a dataset comprising 384 earnings call transcripts from Brazilian banks, along with the accompanying notebooks for preprocessing the transcripts. These notebooks are tailored for fine-tuning BERT- and T5-based models specifically for financial Named Entity Recognition (NER).

Additionally, the pre-print available at [ArXiv](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2403.12212) provides a detailed overview of the comprehensive process involved in fine-tuning and comparing the BERTimbau, mBERT, PTT5, and mT5 models for financial NER.

The paper was published in the [Applied Soft Computing journal](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2024.112158). Please cite this work as follows:
